                    The rate of change since the mid-20th century is unprecedented over millennia.
                    Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to <a href="#">very small variations in Earth’s orbit</a> that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.
                    This graph, based on the comparison of atmospheric samples contained in ice cores and more recent direct measurements, provides evidence that atmospheric CO2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution.
                    Luthi, D., et al.. 2008; Etheridge, D.M., et al. 2010; Vostok ice core data/J.R. Petit et al.; NOAA Mauna Loa CO2 record. <a href="#">Find out more about ice cores</a> (external site).
                    
                    The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun’s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.

                    these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases, there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response.
                    Global Temperature Is Rising
                    The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5

                    What are greenhouse gases?
                    Earth’s greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet. The main gases responsible for the greenhouse effect include carbon dioxide, <a href="#">methane</a> , nitrous oxide, and water vapor. In addition to these natural compounds, synthetic fluorinated gases also function as greenhouse gases. Different greenhouse gases have different chemical properties and are removed from the atmosphere, over time, by various processes. Carbon dioxide, for example, is absorbed by “ <a href="#">carbon sinks</a> ” such as forests, soil, and the ocean. Fluorinated gases are only destroyed by sunlight in the far upper atmosphere.
                    How much any one greenhouse gas influences global warming depends on three key factors: <br> 
                    1.	How much of the gas exists in the atmosphere. Concentrations are measured in parts per million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb), or parts per trillion (ppt). For example, 1 ppm for a given gas means that there is one molecule of that gas in every one million molecules of air. <br>
                    2.	How long the gas remains in the atmosphere, otherwise known as its lifetime. <br>
                    3.	How effective the gas is at trapping heat. This is referred to as its global warming potential (GWP) and is a measure of the total energy that a gas absorbs over a given period of time (usually 100 years) relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide.

                    Burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth’s temperature.
                    This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.
                    Global warming
                    2011-2020 was the warmest decade recorded, with global average temperature reaching 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels in 2019. Human-induced global warming is presently increasing at a rate of 0.2°C per decade.
                    An increase of 2°C compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times is associated with serious negative impacts on to the natural environment and human health and wellbeing, including a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur.
                    For this reason, the international community has recognised the need to keep warming well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.

                    •	Burning coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. <br>
                    •	Cutting down forests (deforestation). Trees help to regulate the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When they are cut down, that beneficial effect is lost and the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. <br>
                    •	Increasing livestock farming. Cows and sheep produce large amounts of methane when they digest their food. <br>
                    •	Fertilisers containing nitrogen produce nitrous oxide emissions. <br>
                    •	Fluorinated gases are emitted from equipment and products that use these gases. Such emissions have a very strong warming effect, up to 23 000 times greater than CO2. <br>
                    Countering climate change 
                    As every tonne of CO2 emitted contributes to global warming, all emissions reductions contribute to slowing it down. In order to stop global warming completely, CO2 emissions have to reach net zero worldwide. In addition, reducing emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, can also have a powerful effect on slowing global warming – especially in the short term.

                    Human-driven causes of climate change
                    <a href="#">Scientists agree</a> that human activity is the primary driver of what we’re seeing now worldwide. (This type of climate change is sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, which is just a way of saying “caused by human beings.”) The unchecked burning of fossil fuels over the past 150 years has drastically increased the presence of atmospheric greenhouse gases, most notably <a href="#">carbon dioxide</a> . At the same time, logging and development have led to the widespread destruction of forests, wetlands, and other <a href="#">carbon sinks</a> —natural resources that store carbon dioxide and prevent it from being released into the atmosphere.
                    Right now, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, <a href="#">methane</a> , and nitrous oxide are the highest they’ve been in the last <a href="#">800,000 years</a> . Some greenhouse gases, like <a href="#">hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs)</a> , do not even exist in nature. By continuously pumping these gases into the air, we helped raise the earth’s average temperature by about <a href="#">1.9 degrees Fahrenheit</a> during the 20th century—which has <a href="#">brought us to our current era</a> of deadly, and increasingly routine, weather extremes. And it’s important to note that while climate change affects everyone in some way, it doesn’t do so equally: All over the world, people of color and those living in economically disadvantaged or politically marginalized communities bear <a href="#">a much larger burden</a> , despite the fact that these communities play a much smaller role in warming the planet.
                    Our ways of generating power for electricity, heat, and transportation, our built environment and industries, our ways of interacting with the land, and our consumption habits together serve as the primary drivers of climate change. While the <a href="#">percentages of greenhouse gases</a> stemming from each source may fluctuate, the sources themselves remain relatively consistent.

                    Carbon dioxide is just one of many greenhouse gases. Learn about their impact on global warming, their origin and their share in EU emissions.

                    Fluorinated greenhouse gases are man-made and have a high global warming potential, often several thousand times stronger than CO2. 
                    The EU is taking action to drastically reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) as they are associated with climate change. The best-known greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2) but others, present in a smaller quantity in the atmosphere, may have a bigger warming effect.
                    What do greenhouses gases do?
                    Greenhouse gases act similarly to the glass in a greenhouse: they absorb the sun’s heat that radiates from the Earth’s surface, trap it in the atmosphere and prevent it from escaping into space. The greenhouse effect keeps the Earth’s temperature warmer than it would otherwise be, supporting life on Earth.
                    Many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, but human activity contributes to their accumulation. As a result, the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere is boosted and it <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/2022-saw-record-temperatures-europe-and-across-world">alters our planet’s climate</a> , leading to shifts in snow and rainfall patterns, a rise in average temperatures and more extreme climate events such as heatwaves and floods.

                    Which greenhouse gases are there?
                    There are different types of greenhouse gases and their global warming potential varies. 
                    Naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere - but also generated through human activities - include among others carbon dioxide, methane (CH4), and nitrous Oxide (N2O).

                    In July 2014, NASA successfully launched the first dedicated Earth remote sensing satellite to study atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) from space. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) is an exploratory science mission designed to collect space-based global measurements of atmospheric CO₂ with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize sources and sinks (fluxes) on regional scales (≥1000 km). This dataset provides global gridded, daily column-averaged carbon dioxide (XCO₂) concentrations from January 1, 2015 - February 28, 2022. The data are derived from OCO-2 observations that were input to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Constituent Data Assimilation System (CoDAS), a modeling and data assimilation system maintained by NASA’s

                    Dataset Accuracy
                    Daily random error statistics (i.e. precisions) are calculated using Desroziers et al. (2005) diagnostics, and can be found in the precision data layer accompanying the XCO₂ data layer. For more information on how these diagnostics are used, please refer to the “Uncertainty quantification” section of the OCO-2 GEOS L3 XCO₂ Product User’s Guide. For estimating systematic errors, analyses against independent data are performed.

                    We often think about <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/are-humans-causing-or-contributing-global-warming">human-induced climate change</a> as something that will happen in the future, but it is happening now. Ecosystems and people in the United States and around the world are affected by the ongoing process of climate change today.

                    Climate change affects the environment in many different ways, including rising temperatures, sea level rise, drought, flooding, and more. These events affect things that we depend upon and value, like water, energy, transportation, wildlife, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.
                    Our changing climate
                    NOAA monitors weather and climate around the world. Here are some of the ways that climate change is affecting our planet. You can explore more at NOAA’s <a href="https://www.climate.gov/maps-data">Global Climate Dashboard</a> .

                    Water
                    The effects of climate change on our <a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/3/#key-message-1">water resources</a> can have a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/weather-climate">big impact</a> on our world and our lives. Patterns of where, when, and how much precipitation falls are changing as temperatures rise. Some areas are experiencing heavier rain events while others are having more droughts.
                    Flooding is an increasing issue as our climate is changing. Compared to the beginning of the 20th century,  <a href="">precipitation events</a> are stronger, heavier, and more frequent across most of the United States.
                    Drought is also becoming <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-drought">more common</a> , especially in the Western United States. We are using more water during hot weather, especially for agriculture. Much like we sweat more when it is hot out,  hot weather causes plants to lose, or transpire, more water. Then, farmers must give their crops more water.
                    <a href="https://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/nsa/">Snowpack</a> is an important source of fresh water for many people. As the snow melts, fresh water becomes available for use. Snowmelt is particularly important in regions like the Western United States where there is not much precipitation in warmer months. But as temperatures warm, there is less snow and snow begins to melt earlier in the year. This means that snowpack is less likely to be a reliable source of water.

                    The image shows groups at higher risk to health threats related to climate change and potential solutions. These groups are among the most at-risk when we consider all of the threats from climate change on top of other environmental hazards. They are the most exposed, sensitive, and have the least resources to prepare for and respond to health threats. White text indicates the risks faced by those communities, while dark text indicates actions that can be taken to reduce those risks.

                    The environment
                    Climate change affects all living things, or organisms, and the environment they live in, but not equally. The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It is warming at least twice as fast as the global average.  Warming in the Arctic has impacts that are felt across the globe — melting land ice sheets and glaciers contribute dramatically offsite link to sea level rise. Sea levels are also rising due to thermal expansion. Higher sea level puts coastal areas at greater risk of erosion and storm surge.  
                    Effects of climate change can build upon one another to damage ecosystems. Sea level rise can cause sediment to smother corals. But, coral reefs are also vulnerable to many other effects of climate change: warming waters can lead to coral bleaching and stronger hurricanes can destroy reefs. Coral reef ecosystems are home to thousands of species, which rely on healthy coral reefs to survive.
                    Some organisms are able to adapt to and even benefit from climate change. Some plants have longer growing seasons or are blooming earlier. But, these changes can happen too fast for other plants and animals to keep up. For example, an earlier blooming plant may depend on a pollinator that does not adapt as quickly. 
                    There are also species that have adapted by expanding or shifting their geographic range, meaning they live in new places that used to be too cold or unsuitable in other ways. As a species expands or shifts its range,
                    Ocean ecosystems face an additional challenge: ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. As a result, the water is becoming more acidic, which affects marine life.

                        <dd>Climate change mitigation involves actions to reduce or prevent greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.
                            Mitigation efforts include transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, adopting regenerative agricultural practices and protecting and restoring forests and critical ecosystems.
                            Effective mitigation requires a whole-of-society approach and structural transformations to reduce emissions and limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
                            International cooperation, for example through the Paris Agreement, is crucial in guiding and achieving global and national mitigation goals.
                            Mitigation efforts face challenges such as the world's deep-rooted dependency on fossil fuels, the increased demand for new mineral resources and the difficulties in revamping our food systems.
                            These challenges also offer opportunities to improve resilience and contribute to sustainable development.

                    Weatherizing doors and windows by sealing drafts can make your home more energy efficient.
                    Rising sea levels. Raging storms. Searing heat. Ferocious fires. Severe drought. Punishing floods. The effects of climate change are already threatening our health, our communities, our economy, our security, and our children’s future.
                    What can you do? A whole lot, as it turns out. Americans, on average, produce 21 tons of carbon a year, about four times the global average. Personal action is, of course, no substitute for meaningful government policies. We still must limit carbon pollution and aggressively move away from dirty fossil fuels toward cleaner power.
                    But it’s important to remember the equally vital contributions that can be made by private citizens—which is to say, by you. “Change only happens when individuals take action,” says clean energy advocate Aliya Haq. “There’s no other way, if it doesn’t start with people.”
                    Here are a dozen easy, effective ways each one of us can make a difference.
                    1. Speak up!
                    What’s the single biggest way you can make an impact on global climate change? “Talk to your friends and family, and make sure your representatives are making good decisions,” Haq says. By voicing your concerns—via social media or, better yet, directly to your elected officials—you send a message that you care about the warming world. Encourage Congress to enact new laws that limit carbon emissions and require polluters to pay for the emissions they produce. “The main reason elected officials do anything difficult is because their constituents make them,” Haq says. You can help protect public lands, stop offshore drilling, and more here.
                    2. Power your home with renewable energy.
                    Choose a utility company that generates at least half its power from wind or solar and has been certified by Green-e Energy, an organization that vets renewable energy options. If that isn’t possible for you, take a look at your electric bill; many utilities now list other ways to support renewable sources on their monthly statements and websites.

                    CAFE Standard
                    The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard regulates the average fuel economy of new vehicles sold in the United States. CAFE standards work by establishing a required fuel economy for the entire fleet of new vehicles (in miles per gallon), with separate standards established for passenger cars and light trucks. Vehicle manufacturers are required to have a sales-weighted average fuel economy that meets or exceeds these fuel economy targets, or pay a penalty that is a function of both their total sales and fuel economy shortfall. Fig. 2.4 illustrates historical values of the CAFE standard for both passenger cars and light trucks, along with projections of potential future fuel economy standards (Shiau et al., 2009).

                    Figure 2.4. Historical CAFE standards, fleet fuel economy, and potential future policy trajectories.
                    Adapted from Shiau, C.-S.N., Michalek, J.J., et al., 2009. A structural analysis of vehicle design responses to corporate average fuel economy policy. Transp. Res. Part A Policy Pract. 43 (9–10), 814–828.
                    CAFE was originally enacted in 1975, in response to the Arab oil embargo. The fuel economy standards increased rapidly from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, then were almost entirely flat through the mid-2000s.
                    To the extent that CAFE standards influence vehicle design decisions, CAFE policies can influence fuel consumption and price in a few ways. First, CAFE policies directly increase the fuel economy of the vehicle fleet, which directly leads to a reduction in fuel consumption. If the total vehicle miles traveled remains constant, then increasing the fuel economy of the fleet leads to a proportional decrease in fuel consumption, though some of those reductions in demand may be erased by the rebound effect. This demand reduction would directly lead to a reduction in price.
                    Second, CAFE standards may impact consumer decisions about whether or not to purchase a new vehicle. If CAFE standards are high, and are accompanied by large penalties for violation, then they can influence vehicle design decisions in a way that steers the set of available vehicles away from the optimal set determined by the market based on consumer preferences, potentially leading to fewer new vehicle purchases. This secondary impact would primarily affect consumers looking for vehicles with low fuel economy and could therefore lead to additional increases in the fuel economy of the fleet. However, there may be some instances in which consumers decide not to purchase a new vehicle, and instead continue to drive old vehicles with poor fuel economy, leading to an increase in fuel consumption relative to the consumption from any new vehicle

                How much a CDS can save
                Over 10 years, a CDS can save you $480 to $2,800 in fuel costs and lower your carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 1,100 to 6,440 kg. At the high end, this is equivalent to
                •	nearly 1.5 Olympic-sized swimming pools of CO2
                •	removing a large SUV from Canadian roads for one year
                •	about 30% of our annual per capita emissions in Canada, which is 22.1 tonnes
                This table shows what a cylinder deactivation system can save you over time.
                *Based on an annual driving distance of 20,000 km, a fuel price of $1.00/L and a CO2 emissions factor of 2.3 kg/L of gasoline.

                Research before you buy. Estimate how much fuel your vehicle will consume over its lifetime.
                Turbocharging
                Vehicle manufacturers are adding energy-efficient technologies such as turbochargers to their products to meet Canada’s increasingly stringent greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty vehicles.
                Using a smaller, turbocharged engine can lower fuel consumption by 2 to 6%. This saves you money and reduces your impact on the environment.

                <p class="hidden">
                    Climate change has been a concern for decades, but NASA recently confirmed that 2020 tied with 2016 for the warmest year since record keeping began in 1880 (see Figure 1). We’ve seen 19 of the warmest ever years occurring since 2000, and with that comes increasingly frequent temperature extremes, high winds, floods and fires. Increased urbanization and deforestation are impacting biodiversity. According to the World Wildlife Found, humans are now overusing the earth’s biocapacity ie its ability to regenerate, by at least 56%. All of these factors lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, which in turn raises the planet’s average temperatures.
                    Source: NASA
                    Figure 1. Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index
                    National Geographic reports that the world's seas have absorbed more than 90% of the heat from these GHG, and that is taking its toll. Polar ice caps are melting and sea levels around the US have risen six and half inches since the 1950s. They’re expected to rise by another six inches in less than 20 years, and by 10-30 inches by 2100. This will reduce the areas where humans can live and grow food.
                    This climate emergency has the potential to unleash far greater disruption on the planet than the recent coronavirus pandemic. Its effects will last longer too but, it’s still possible for humanity to exert some control over the situation. And technology sits at the heart of solutions to manage carbon emissions and energy efficiency.
                    Digital technologies can provide a solution 
                    During the pandemic, the importance of digitalization became clear. Economic growth stalled as societies went into lockdown with people living and working from home instead of commuting and travelling. Remote working, online education, streaming video on demand, and video-based socializing drove people on to fixed and mobile broadband networks, to use digital tools and services. The result was a reduction in air pollution.
                    According to Dr Ajay Gambhir, a senior research fellow from the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, 2020 carbon emissions were down by 20% when comparing April 2020 with April 2019 and 7% on a year on year, as many switched to online working and shopping.

                    However, these recent declines go against the overall trend. NASA for example reports that carbon dioxide from human activity is increasing more than 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age (see Figure 2).

                    Figure 2. Carbon dioxide levels are increasing
                    The pandemic also spawned the term ‘The Great Reset’. This term is used by the World Economic Forum and the Financial Times among others, and represents a call to action to create a more sustainable world. One that ensures a fairer, more inclusive society and economy in terms of access to digital services. Importantly it must also protect and rejuvenate the environment, which is the basis for all societies and economies.

                    Rodrigo Arias, the lead for the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 5G Global Accelerator Program agrees that 5G has a major role to play in the digital and sustainable economy.
                    “The speed of change, pervasive scope and impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is completely different from anything we have seen before,” says Arias. However, from a technology perspective, it is the fusion of the new digital technologies that make for exciting possibilities. Arias calls out 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), virtual and augmented reality (AR/VR), and robotics as the basis for innovation, but autonomous vehicles, drones, 3D printing, quantum computing, and bio and nano technology will also produce impactful use cases. He elaborates on the importance of 5G saying, “WEF has studies that show 5G is the global accelerator for many of the use cases in the digital economy.” A WEF report – The Impact of 5G: Creating New Value across Industries and Society – outlines how 5G enables the top five use case categories: IoT, AR/VR, autonomous driving, drones, and robotics.
                    “5G and connectivity can address each of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals.”
